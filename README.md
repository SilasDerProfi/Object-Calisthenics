# OC - Object Calisthenics

All projects in this repository comply with the rules for the object calisthenics:
1. Only one level of indentation per method
2. Donâ€™t use `else`, `else if` or `switch/case`
3. Wrap all primitives and strings (this is unfortunately a problem with C#)
4. Only one dot per line
5. Don't abbreviate variable names
6. Keep all entities small (~50 Lines, >= 10 classes per Folder)
7. Maximum 2 instance variables per class
8. First Class Collections (A collection or other instance variables, not both)
9. No getters, setters or other constructs to read data from a class
